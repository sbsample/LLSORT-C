This exercise reads in a file, sorts the lines by the first character, and outputs a sorted string of the indices of the array of lines.

Use make to compile the program.
Use make clean to clean up binary and class files.

The program contains the following files.

List.c - this file creates a Double Linked List ADT with numerous commands

Lex.c - this inputs, outputs, and sorts the line data.

Makefile - compiles and cleans the program.

ListClient.c - test code.

README- the file you are reading now.
